<h1><i>Why do you love seals so much?</i></h1>
<body>
    <p>I'm not sure I can tell you exactly where seal mania started, just that it is here. <br>
        To be honest, I never knew much about seals for the majority of my life, as most people do.
        The only seal content i had ever seen was <a href=https://youtu.be/kb_GJkry3M8?si=Ynsgc0Gm4wuLJRrZ> this </a> video of an elephant seal on YouTube many years ago. <br>
        However, in 2022 I saw this image posted on the internet, and became very curious about the <a href=https://youtu.be/eXV8cd1kLNU?si=TZD8kLjEd42MM1iR>original video</a>, by seal photographer Rei Ohara. <br>
        Since then, I have become more and more enamored with seals every day, wanting to learn more about them and how they live, regardless of age or species.<br>
        My love of seals has led to me making many friends both online and offline, and has helped me gain confidence to be who I am and speak on what I want to without fear, so I am eternally grateful. <br>

        I hope this website encourages others to appreciate the humble seal, and gives some explanation as to why I am the way I am.
