<p> I've tried my best to use images in the public domain and link back to all private sources, but if I
    have messed up on credit and/or you would like me to take your data off of this website, please let me know and I will gladly do so</p><br>
    <p> The goal of this site is to spread helpful information and appreciation toward seals and other's who also admire them,
        and as such I would hate to ever use someone's work in a way that is against their wishes</p>
